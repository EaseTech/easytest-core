/**
 * An interface for different types of loader. 
 * This would ultimately be used by the users of EasyTest as well to provide their custom Loaders.
 * Currently, EasyTest supports three Loaders internally :
 * <li> {@link ExcelDataLoader} - To load data from XLS files</li>
 * <li> {@link XMLDataLoader} - To load data from XML files. Look at the Schema for XML at : 
 * https://github.com/EaseTech/easytest-core/blob/master/src/main/resources/testDataSchema.xsd</li>
 * <li> {@link CSVDataLoader} - To load data from a CSV file
 * 
 * In addition users can define their own custom Loaders and use them in their test 
 * classes by specifying the {@link LoaderType#CUSTOM} loader type in their {@link DataLoader} annotation
